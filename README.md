# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

The next one is the login page 
and when you are registered and in, the learning materials page, when we log out or go to the main home page "/" 
1. If we are logged out, the register button on the header should show login instead of register because we already have the account
2. If we are logged in and we go to the home page, it should neither show login nor register; instead, it should show an icon, and when we click it, it can show things like profile and logout, and some of the links should change to My Courses

3. If i pay for frontend it should go to learning-materials-frontend if i pay for backend it should pay for learning-materials backend and if i pay for full stack it should take me to the main learning-materials and for those people who did part payment let there be a count down so that for frontend and backend after 2 months the users wont have access to the learning pages and for full stack development after 4 months the same thing should happen and it should take them to a payment page where they will see how much they are owning and pay it there  the the payment type will change to full payment 
Note: After time is up, it should redirect to a payment page where they will pay
